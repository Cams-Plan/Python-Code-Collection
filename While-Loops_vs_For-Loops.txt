When to use for loops:
  If you need to manipulate every subject item that you're interating through
  If the condition subject can be predicted
  If the item or index of iteration is important to the programme

When to use While loops:
  If a sequence needs to be repeated until a condition is met
  If every item specified in the condition statement don't need direct repetitive manipulation
