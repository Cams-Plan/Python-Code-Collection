### Exercise 1 from Day 8 of 100 Days of Code: Utilises Dictionaries (target skill) and Functions. ###

    #Section 1 = My annotated code
    #Section 2 = Original unedited code

  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,

# 1 Create an empty dictionary called student_grades.

# 2 Create a function that converts the value in student_scores to be used in a for loop.    
def score_converter(stu_score):
    #converts the 'value' from student_scores dictionary, into a string representative of the score range when used in for loop using 'key' as item.
    if int(student_scores[key]) <= 70:
        return("Fail")
    elif int(student_scores[key]) in range(71,80):
        return("Acceptable")
    elif int(student_scores[key]) in range(81,90):
        return("Exceeds Expectations")
    elif int(student_scores[key]) in range(91,100):
        return("Outstanding")
    
# 3 Run a for loop to add the new grades from the converter into the student_grades dictionary.
for key in student_scores:
    student_grades[key] = score_converter(student_scores[key])
    
# 4 Display the new student grades
print(student_grades)

        ## First I created a function that will convert a single dictionary value when called upon.
        ## Each if statement calls on the value within the target dictionary (student_scores) using student_scores[key] and checks it against the scoring band.
        ## The int() was used as a precaution to ensure that there is no type error when comparing to the range().
        ## return() was used instead of print() to minimise wasted processes, and allow the result of the function to be used outside of the function.
    # 3
        ## Next I used a for loop to introduce the 'key' dictionary index for the converter function.
        ## score_converter(student_scores[key]) = the result of the function to be entered as the student_grades value.
